## Dataset
We are using the dataset downloaded from FAO-stats and can be seen / download [here](../00_resources/data/data.xlsx).

## **Overview**
Agricultural emissions data is essential for understanding the environmental impact of farming activities worldwide. This dataset contains information on emissions of greenhouse gases, such as methane (CH‚ÇÑ), from agricultural land across different regions and years. Proper analysis of these emissions is critical for climate policy, sustainable agriculture, and environmental impact assessments. 

The characteristics of this dataset play a crucial role in determining how machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models can be used to analyze and interpret these data points effectively. This document explores the key characteristics of the dataset, particularly focusing on data structure, temporal trends, and challenges in handling such information for AI-based modeling.

## **Key Characteristics of the Dataset**
The following table summarizes the primary characteristics of the dataset and their implications for training and fine-tuning AI models for agricultural emissions analysis:

| **Characteristic**          | **Description** |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Domain**             | Greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., CH‚ÇÑ) from agricultural land |
| **Geographical Coverage**   | Multiple countries (e.g., Afghanistan, Germany) with area codes based on M49 classification |
| **Temporal Coverage**       | Multi-year data ranging from 1990 onwards |
| **Data Source**             | FAO TIER 1 estimates |
| **Measurement Units**       | Emissions in kilotons (kt) |
| **Key Variables**           | Year, country, emission type, emission values, data sources |
| **Data Annotations**        | Estimated values with uncertainty flags (e.g., "E" for estimated) |
| **Variability**             | Different emission types and trends across countries and years |
| **Data Format**             | Structured tabular data in Excel format |

## **Challenges in Handling Agricultural Emissions Data**
- **Temporal Trends & Forecasting**: Since emissions data varies yearly, AI models must handle time-series forecasting efficiently.
- **Geospatial Variability**: Different countries have distinct agricultural practices, affecting emissions patterns.
- **Data Quality & Uncertainty**: The dataset contains estimated values, requiring robust uncertainty quantification techniques.
- **Scalability for AI Models**: Large-scale emissions data need efficient data processing and model tuning.
- **Multimodal Data Integration**: Agricultural emissions data can be linked with climate, soil, and economic datasets for deeper insights.

## **Example Data Records**
A sample of the dataset, including emissions data from Germany, is shown below:

| **Country**   | **Year** | **Emission Type** | **Emissions (kt)** | **Data Source** |
|--------------|---------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Germany     | 1990    | CH‚ÇÑ (Methane)    | 2082.53          | FAO TIER 1 |
| Germany     | 1991    | CH‚ÇÑ (Methane)    | 1949.25          | FAO TIER 1 |
| Germany     | 1992    | CH‚ÇÑ (Methane)    | 1740.08          | FAO TIER 1 |

## **Conclusion**
Understanding the key characteristics of agricultural emissions data is essential for developing AI models for climate impact assessment. The dataset's structured nature makes it suitable for machine learning applications, but challenges like data uncertainty, temporal trends, and geospatial variations must be carefully addressed. AI-driven solutions can help predict future emissions, assess policy impacts, and guide sustainable agriculture initiatives.
