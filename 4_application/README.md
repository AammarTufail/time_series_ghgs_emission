# Forecasting Greenhousegases emission from globalagricultural land

Application of machine learning models for forecasting greenhouse gases emissions from agricultural land. The project is divided into two parts. The first part is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Greenhouse Gases Emission Forecasting. The second part is Machine Learning based prediction of CH₄, N₂O, CO₂ emissions from agricultural land.

## Installation

To run the app, you need to install the following libraries:

pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib prophet scikit-learn
```
Then you can run the [app](./app.py) with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## We will use the following dataset:
